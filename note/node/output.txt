Each keyword must be on a line by itself and each keyword line must start with an at-sign (i.e. '@') in the first character position on the line. Furthermore, all keyword lines MUST be the first lines on the file (i.e. the end of the keyword list is the first line without an at sign in column one). The keyword specified on a keyword line is considered to start with the first non-blank character after the at-sign and end with the last non-blank character on the line. Hence, a line of \ dog " contains the keyword \dog" and a line of \ dog & cat " contains the ONE keyword \dog & cat". Obviously, keywords may contain blanks.
