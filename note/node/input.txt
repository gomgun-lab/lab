Each keyword must be on a line by itself and each keyword line must start with an at-sign
(i.e. '@') in the rst character position on the line. Furthermore, all keyword lines MUST be
the rst lines on the le (i.e. the end of the keyword list is the rst line without an at sign in
column one).
The keyword specied on a keyword line is considered to start with the rst non-blank
character after the at-sign and end with the last non-blank character on the line. Hence, a
line of \ dog " contains the keyword \dog" and a line of \ dog & cat " contains the ONE
keyword \dog & cat". Obviously, keywords may contain blanks.
